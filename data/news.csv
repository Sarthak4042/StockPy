Investors are looking for those that are winning that battle. In the latest Good Buy or Goodbye, Washington Crossing Advisors Senior Portfolio Manager Chad Morganlander says Tractor Supply (TSCO) is worth adding to your portfolio, but Macy's (M) is a skip. Morganlander gives three reasons why Tractor Supply is a buy: its rising dividend, the high return on capital for its business model, and its unique positioning as a retailer that caters to farmers and more rural shoppers. Morganlander is less of a fan of Macy's. He doesn't like the retailer's debt situation, describing it as an ""anchor"" for the company. Morganlander also points to Macy's revenue saying the company is ""trying to rationalize their footprint and it's like a battleship trying to make a U-turn in a closet,"" adding that Macy's is struggling to find relevance in a crowded retail space. He also points to an overall slowdown in consumer spending that Macy's may be more vulnerable to than other retailers.  For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

439ce109-8b6e-3447-8bad-24e3606cb05c;M;What a Biden-Trump rematch means for the largest retail stocks;If there has been any constant down the aisles of supermarkets and on the racks at clothing stores, it’s inflation. While inflation has started to cool down, the reality is that prices continue to be high — and that remains a key issue for consumers. Some retailers have fared well against this backdrop, namely Walmart (WMT). Others like Macy’s (M) and Best Buy (BBY) have struggled as households cut back on non-essential items. The issue of inflation will take center stage with voters in the November presidential election and could weigh on retailers until the race for the White House is over. So what’s the best retail investment strategy during this political news storm?
